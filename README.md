# The Odin Project - Admin dashboard solution

This is a solution to [Project: Admin Dashboard for the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). The Odin Project provides a free open-source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.

Project: Admin Dashboard is one of two projects in the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css). It provides an opportunity to practice building layouts with CSS Grid.

## Overview

The brief for this project was to build out an admin dashboard similar to the one in the design file, using CSS grid for the majority of the layout work.

## My process

### Build with

- CSS grid
- SVG icons
- Custom list markers
- Tooltips

### What I learned

Three things in this solution that I had not used in projects before are:

- CSS grid

### Continued development

For my solution, I only used HTML and CSS features that were covered in the curriculum of the [Full Stack JavaScript learning path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) up to this project.

Responsive design is not covered until much later in the curriculum. I made my solution as responsive as possible with the tools I had available, using CSS grid and flexbox, but no media queries.

Web accessibility is also covered much later in the curriculum. I used what I have learned about accessibility while working on [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
